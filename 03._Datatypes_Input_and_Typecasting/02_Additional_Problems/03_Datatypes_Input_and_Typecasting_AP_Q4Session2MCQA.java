The correct answer is:

Explanation:
Java supports two types of type conversion:

Widening Type Conversion (Implicit Conversion)

Automatically done by the compiler.

Converts a smaller data type to a larger data type.

Example: int to long, float to double.

Narrowing Type Conversion (Explicit Conversion)

Must be done manually by the programmer using casting.

Converts a larger data type to a smaller data type.

Example: double to int, long to short.
