}

// Answer :- first one , Loss of Data

/*

The correct answer is:

Loss of Data

Explanation:
Narrowing Type Conversion in Java may result in loss of data 
because you're converting from a larger data type to a smaller data type. 
This can lead to truncation or overflow if the value doesnâ€™t fit in the 
target type.

Example:

double d = 123.456;
int i = (int) d;  // i becomes 123, the fractional part is lost
